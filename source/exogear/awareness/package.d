	/// use-cases while avoiding the (pre)allocation of large regions of memory.
	///
	/// Be aware that this may also change between formatters (ex: two "%s"

TODO:

keep template invocations lean: probably just append text to each invocation,
along with some serialized metadata about that segment (length of fmtstr,
est max size required for each format arg, purpose of segment (detail, param,
advise), tree level). This avoids having template instantiations filled with
long type names repeated over and over (ex: the FQN of a ReportSegment
container struct or w/e). Once at the end of the chain, process the
compile time information to generate an immutable or enum Report struct.
If Exception is used, it all must be formatted at constructor invocation.
If AlternativeException (name?) is used, then the formatting can be delayed
until the catch clause deals with it using a range interface (well, the range
might be internal, or the interface would just output chunks of formatted
text and the caller only needs to dump them somewhere, like stdout/stderr).
This might prevent large allocations entirely: the static text never needs
to be copied into a large buffer, it is just pushed directly onto whatever
I/O or handler awaits it on the other side. Formatted values still need to
have memory preallocated for them, but in many cases this will probably be
dwarfed by the size of the static strings, so this could be big savings
(exception: if the formatted value is a large array or something, then it
might be much bigger than the format string parts surrounding it).

The OOP interface I was creating is probably unnecessary. Just put all
needed features into one struct. The struct should not be templated.
Any compile time information entering the struct should be normalized
into string form or some other common attribute.

TODO: How to make Handler implementations aware of the compile-time information?
The Handler will be important for determining the size required for all of
the formatting and stuff. (Or maybe not. It could be that the Report will
handle formatting of all individual strings and format-x-args sections, but
that it won't do any compile-time interpretation of the segment meanings. That
gets delayed until runtime. This might work alright, as the Handler would
not be operating in the context where an exception is being thrown, and
it a lot of its content might be static strings that can, like the others
available at compile-time, just be dump into a stream or output range like
stdout.

.param members should be turned into formatstrings by the Handler before any
size estimation is concluded. This means the Handler may require at least
two passes: one format string generation pass, then another pass to actually
produce a range of string fragments for consumption by streams/logs/stdout/etc.
